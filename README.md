# Heracudo
### Heroku review applications custom domain hooks.

Special heroku review application hooks which make usage of fancy custom review application domain possible.

Heroku Review Apps + Cloudflare + Github Pull Requests

### Installation
1. `npm i heracudo --save` Must be installed in `dependencies`, not `devDependencies`, in order not to be pruned after Heroku installation process.
2. Edit your `app.json`:
    ```json
      {
        "scripts": {
          "postdeploy": "hrcd-postdeploy",
          "pr-predestroy": "hrcd-predestroy"
        }
      }
    ```
    2.1 **Optionally** edit your `package.json`. Used to mark links as _pending_ or _ready_ when Heroku review application is rebuilding after Github pull request receives new commits. Add this hooks in scripts which works best for you, when application started rebuilding, and before starting the application.
    ```json
      {
        "scripts": {
          "postinstall": "hrcd-markpending",
          "postbuild": "hrcd-markready"
        }
      }
    ```
